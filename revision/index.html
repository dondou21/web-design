                    AUCA: A Modern Day Calling, Rooted in Israel’s Mission
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the very beginning, God called Israel to be a light to 
                    the nations — people set apart to present His character, 
                    uplift His law, and serve as a blessing to the world. 
                    Adventist University of Central Africa (AUCA) pursues 
                    that same divine calling today.
